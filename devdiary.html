        <h2>Update 2.3: Rebranding</h2>
        <p><em>6/21/2025 | 3:45pm CST</em></p>
        <p>Big news! SneefStream has a fresh new look. For the first time ever, we’ve introduced a brand new logo that captures the spirit of SneefStream perfectly. We think it’s bold, modern, and fun, and we hope you love it too!</p>
        <p>We’ve also completed our Slate UI across the entire platform. From sneef.stream to the watch portal, everything now looks polished, cohesive, and easy to navigate. We’re excited for you to experience this sleeker, smoother SneefStream.</p>

        <h2>Update 2.2: Requests</h2>
        <p><em>6/15/2025 | 2:07pm CST</em></p>
        <p>We’re excited to being pushing SneefStream Update 2.2 this afternoon, packed with new features and optimizations.</p>
        <p>First up, we've made several UI optimizations, improving the overall design for smoother navigation and a more visually appealing experience. This visual update is a part of our continued effort to expand and polish the Slate UI introduced in 2.0. Along with a sleek new interface, we've also expanded our library significantly, adding a wide selection of new shows and movies to enjoy.</p>
        <p>In addition to these updates, we're unveiling a new and improved homepage at sneef.stream, making it easier than ever to access your content. Viewers can stream at the new watch.sneef.stream, so make sure to update your phone and TV apps to connect. But the biggest change by far is the launch of our new Requests Webpage at add.sneef.stream. This exciting feature allows you to browse a variety of content available for request and submit your own suggestions for what you’d like to see next. Once your request is approved, typically within minutes, the requested show or movie will be automatically added to the platform. You’ll even be able to track download times and processing periods so you can stay updated on when your favorite content will be ready to watch.</p>
        <p>We can’t wait for you to explore all the new additions in SneefStream 2.2!</p>

        <h2>Update 2.1: relax.</h2>
        <p><em>6/11/2025 | 4:30pm CST</em></p>
        <p>SneefStream Update 2.1 is here, bringing a wave of improvements designed to make your experience even smoother and more reliable. This update focuses on ironing out a variety of bugs and connection issues, ensuring a more stable and seamless experience across the platform.</p>
        <p>We’ve also introduced a new Status Page so you can easily check the health of the server and stay informed about its performance.</p>
        <p>But the most exciting addition in this update is our new 'Relax.' collection. With over 50 soothing audio tracks, this cozy feature is perfect for relaxing, sleeping, or getting into a focused, productive zone. Whether you need a peaceful backdrop for a good night’s sleep or calming sounds to help you concentrate, 'Relax.' is here to bring comfort to your day.</p>
        <p>Update 2.1 might be quieter, but it’s all about making your experience just a little bit smoother and more comforting.</p>

        <h2>Update 2.0: The Big Update</h2>
        <p><em>6/5/2025 | 5:53pm CST</em></p>
        <p><strong>Tailscale, No More</strong><br>
        SneefStream is finally accessible without the need to connect to the TailScale service first. Users can simply use the new "sneef.stream" host URL when signing in and be connected with no hassle. With this also comes the new addition of streaming SneefStream from your web browser! The old TailScale host URL will remain functional until July 1st, 2025. After this, it will no longer function, so we recommend making the switch now.</p>
        <p><strong>Live TV & DVR</strong><br>
        Don't know what to watch? Not seeing what you're looking for? SneefStream now has live cable television. Stream 100+ premium cable channels completely free. Some users will also begin seeing the ability to schedule to record their favorite shows to the new Live Recordings category up to a week in advance.</p>
        <p><strong>Content Expansion</strong><br>
        The content library has doubled in size! We've added 100+ movies and 10+ new shows. This content expansion is still ongoing, so keep an eye on the recently added sections!</p>
        <p><strong>And A Lot More</strong><br>
        Group Play now allows users to stream content together even when they're apart.<br>
        We've introduced a new 'Slate' design with easier navigation and more personal customization to give your home screen your own personal touch.<br>
        Over 50 bugs and backend errors squashed. The platform should run much smoother and with very few hiccups moving forward.<br>
        The existing content library has had a full metadata refresh to make sure each movie and show has the proper images, descriptions, actors, and ratings.<br>
        New subtitles engine adds missing subtitles to content without them and automatically fixes broken or mistimed subtitles that already exist. This is something that will happen over time as it combs through the existing and new library of content.</p>
